# Traveling Salesman Problem
Different ways of solving TSP:
<li>Exhaustive Search - Iterates through every single permutation of the route, evaluating each one</li>
<li>Genetic Algorithm - Treats routes as strands of dna, and evolves them based on fitness(determined as 1/distance) until they converge</li>
<li>Simulated Annealing - Simulates the annealing process in smelting to slowly approach an optimal route</li>
<li>Random Search - Generates a set number of routes randomly and evaluates each one</li>
